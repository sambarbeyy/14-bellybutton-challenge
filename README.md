# 14-bellybutton-challenge

The goal of this assignment was to create an interactive dashboard which allows us to browse data from a Bellybutton Bacteria dataset.

The steps to create this interactive dashboard were:

1. Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.

2. Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

    *Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

    *Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

    *Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.
